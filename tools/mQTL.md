## Description
Metabolomic quantitative trait locus (mQTL) mapping, is a CRAN package that provides mQLT analysis for 1H NMR data. Recursive segmentwise peak alignment (RSPA) is used for peak alignment. Normalisation is performed using the QPN approach. Dimensionality reduction can be performed using SRV. QTL mapping is performed using the 'qtl' package. There is no paper available for this package. All of the functions for this package are also included in the mQTL.NMR bioconductor package, which also includes additional functionality and is written by the same authors.
