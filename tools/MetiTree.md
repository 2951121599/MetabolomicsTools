## Description
This is designed for the annotation of MS/MS data. It integrates the MEF tool to assign elemental composition and neutral losses to the fragments. Newly acquired MS/MS data can also be compared to MS/MS data already in the library. There is also a spectral viewer to visualise the MS/MS data. Inputted data can be processed several times with different parameters to discover the best parameters to use for processing. MSn data can be labelled with InChI identifiers.
