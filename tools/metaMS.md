# metaMS
Version: 1.10.0

## Website
https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metaMS.html

## Description
This bioconductor package is based on xcms and CAMERA but with a number of differences as it is adapted for GC-MS analysis. Unlike xcms, it performs a pseudospectra based analysis, rather than a feature based analysis, which avoids the alignment stage (which can be difficult in GC-MS data). There is also the ability to create a database of in-house standards.  It also contains a wrapper function of xcms and CAMERA for LC-MS analysis and the ability to create a database of standards for automatic annotation of these metabolites.
