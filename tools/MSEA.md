## Description
Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) offers three kinds of enrichment analysis: overrepresentation analysis (ORA), single sample profiling (SSP) and quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA, based on the globaltest algorithm). When only a compound list is available ORA is performed, when compound names and concentrations are available SSP is performed and when concentrations are available for multiple samples QEA is performed. Pathways were generated using HMDB (location), MIC, Pubmed and SMPDB (pathway based). Bonferroni correction or FDR can be applied to p-values. R scripts used in the analysis are available to download. As of 2011 MSEA is part of MetaboAnalyst.
