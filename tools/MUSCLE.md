## Description
Multi-platform Unbiased optimisation of Spectrometry via Closed Loop Experimentation (MUSCLE) is designed for experimental optimisation of targeted LC-MS/MS analysis. It is instrument-manufacturer independent (it has been tested on the Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage and the Waters Xevo TQ). MUSCLE is able to control multiple instrumental parameters using visual scripting, which imitate keyboard and mouse commands. As input the user must specify which biochemicals will be analysed and what parameters to optimise. The parameters are then optimised using a PESA-II multi-objective genetic algorithm.
