## Description
This is a Taverna based tool that provides modules which integrate into a workflow for analysing LC-MS data, including annotation and putative metabolite annotation. The three modules are for metabolite feature annotation, metabolite annotation and correlation analysis. Firstly the (already peak picked?) data undergo correlational analysis using either Pearson or Spearman rank correlations in the List_CorrData module. Next features are annotated as isotopes, adducts, dimers or others using accurate m/z difference and RT and median peak area in the annotate_MassMatch module. In the final module, matchMMF_MF, metabolites are putatively identified using the Manchester Metabolomics Database, which is built from HMDB, KEGG, LipidMaps, BioCyc and DrugBank.
