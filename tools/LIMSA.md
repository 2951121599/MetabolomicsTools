## Description
Lipid Mass Spectrum Analysis (LIMSA) provides deconvolution, metabolite identification and quantification of lipidomics LC-MS data. Firstly background subtraction is performed (the spectra are divided into equal segments, a median filter is used and the lowest intensity of each segment is found and linear regression is calculated through the lowest points). Next the raw data are smoothed with a Gaussian filter and the local maximums are selected as candidate peak positions and local minimums as peak limits and the peaks are integrated between these limits. The user then specifies a compound list from the internal database, which contains >3000 lipids along with common fragments/adducts and lipids are identified. The user can add sum formula to the database and additional isotopes to the isotope database. There are three methods of deconvolution available: subtraction, linear fit and a Gaussian peak model. It is available as an Excel add-in or a standalone command line program.
