## Description
This R package provides linear mixed-effect modeling (with regression and ANOVA terms) normalisation and statistical comparison between samples. Multiple different kinds of linear modeling are available: fixed linear models and linear mixed models. These models still require that an IS is present. The Shapiro-Wilk test is included to test for normality and Levene's test of equality of variance is also included. Pairwise mean fold changes are then calculated between treatment groups and heat maps of metabolites with significantly different signal intensities between treatment groups are visualised.
