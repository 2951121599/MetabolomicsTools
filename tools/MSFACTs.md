## Description
Metabolomics spectral formatting, alignment and conversion tools (MSFACTS) provides alignment and reformatting of GC-MS metabolomics data. To do this two applications are provided: RTAlign and RICExtract. RTAlign accepts multiple integrated peak lists, which it then aligns by retention time. RICExtract allows for the alignment of raw chromatographic or spectral data by binning. It extracts total or reconstructed ion chromatographic (RIC) from metabolomics data.
