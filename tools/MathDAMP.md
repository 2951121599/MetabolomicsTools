## Description
Mathematica package for differential analysis of metabolite profiles (MathDAMP) provides functions for preprocessing and normalisation. Firstly raw datasets are binned via m/z and baselines may be subtracted (first order polynomial is default). Noise is removed by set all signal intensities within a given threshold to zero. Sample datasets are then normalised to a reference dataset pairwise, by retention time of a representative set of peaks using dynamic time warping. Outliers may be detected by calculating z-scores or quartile analysis. One-way ANOVA by be used to find differences between groups of replicated datasets. Density plots are used for visualisation.
