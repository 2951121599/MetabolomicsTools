## Description
Metabolite compound feature extraction and identification (MET-COFEI) is a data processing platform for GC-MS data. It consists of three modules: compound feature extraction, compound identification and compound alignment. The compound feature extraction module itself consists of three submodules: EIC extraction, peak detection and peak filtering. Compound identification also consists of three submodules: peak grouping, pure spectrum reconstructing and library searching. The meaningful mass traces are first extracted with EIC extraction. Peak detection is then performed for each of these mass traces. Poor quality peaks are then filtered out with peak filtering. Peaks with similar retention time and peak shape are then clustered with peak grouping. All the m/z intensity pairs at the apex position in the same group are then combined to reconstruct a pure spectrum. A user specified library (.msl) is then searched for metabolite identification. Compounds are then aligned across samples.
