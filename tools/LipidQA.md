## Description
Lipid Qualitative/Quantitative Analysis (LipidQA) provides smoothing, noise reduction, deconvolution, deisotoping, normalisation and metabolite identification of DI-MS lipidomics data. Peak lists are loaded and then can optionally undergo 5-point triangular smoothing and noise filtering. Next the data are deconvoluted and deisotoped. MS/MS data are searched against a fragment ion database (existing within the website) for identification. If a m/z value does not match any recorded MS/MS spectra, a lipid chemical formula database is searched and identified formulas are used to generate theoretical isotope distributions for deisotoping. Finally there are two options for quantification: Absolute Quantification and Lipid Phosphorus Normalisation. In absolute quantification, relative intensity values are compared to a calibration curve for quantification. For lipid phosphorus normalisation, the lipid phosphorus content must be specified and the quantify of each lipid species is normalised to this value.
