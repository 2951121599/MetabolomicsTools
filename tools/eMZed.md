## Description
This provides a library of modules that can be incorporated together as a workflow. The MetaboFeatureFinder (OpenMS) and matched filter and centWave (XCMS) peak picking algorithms can be used for feature detection (eMZed builds a bridge to R). EICs can be visualised. Once peaks are detected they can be integrated using the EMG integrator. Retention time alignment is then performed using Pose Clustering alignment algorithm (OpenMS). Isotope patterns are identified and compounds are identified from PubChem. Two datasets can be compared using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis statistical tests.
