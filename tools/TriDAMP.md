## Description
This is an add on the MathDAMP. It provides three-way comparison of metabolomic datasets, allowing visualisation using the HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) model. The two most distant absolute values are found, the results are then displayed as density plots. If all three values are the same, the results are displayed in white, if two are the same, then the hue will be set by the other value and if all three are different then the colour selected will be based on the difference between the two most distant values.
