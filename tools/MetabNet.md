## Description
This used to map targeted MWAS data onto pathways. Full or partial correlation networks can be generated. For partial correlation analysis, the correlation between 2 variables is adjusted to take into account other variables. This is performed using the corpcor R package. For input both a peak list and a list of target metabolites with retention times must be included. For a targeted MWAS to be performed, a list of discriminatory features between conditions must also be provided. Network plots are generated and can be used as input into Cytoscape.
