## Description
MZedDB is a database of potential adducts and neutral losses, that can be searched by sum formula, accurate mass, nominal mass or metabolite name. It can thus provide potential annotations for accurate mass, including the ability to predict the empirical formula, whilst taking into account adducts, neutral losses and isotopes. For database searches: KEGG, Metacyc and HMDB can be searched. The user can specify searches for metabolites found in a specific organism by interfacing with KEGG. MZedDB can be interfaced with R using a supplied script.
