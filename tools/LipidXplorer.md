## Description
This provides alignment, annotation and metabolite identification of DI-MS lipidomics data, gathered in any mode from any tandem mass spectrometer. Firstly individual scans are merged into representative spectra. Peaks are then aligned and the signal intensity weighted average of a clustered group of peaks is used to substitute their masses. Peak intensities are stored in MasterScan. Precursor and fragment ions can serve as 'signatures' leading to lipid identification. The molecular fragment query language (MFQL) is used for searching for lipid annotations, typically searching one lipid class at a time.
