## Description
This R package is designed to evaluate the suitability of different normalisation methods for a dataset that is normally distributed, in a tab separated file with intensities. 12 different normalisation methods are evaluated: total intensity (TI), median intensity (MedI), average intensity (AI), quantile, NormFinder (NF), variance stabilising normalisation (VSN), robust linear regression (RLR) and LOESS are all global normalisation methods; VSN, RLR and LOESS are also implemented as local methods, where within replicate groups are normalised separately. These different normalisation techniques are then evaluated using many methods including: total intensity, total missing values, pooled intragroup coefficient of variation (PCV) and pearson's and spearman's correlation. The results of these evaluations are then outputted in a report. It is specifically designed for proteomics and DNA microarray and has not been tested for metabolomics by the authors.
