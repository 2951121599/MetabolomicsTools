## Description
MetFrag is available as a web app, command line tool and R package, enabling identification of MSn data fragments that are not found in existing databases. It queries PubChem, KEGG Compounds and ChemSpider to identify candidate molecules and then generates all possible topological fragments for the candidate compound. These fragments can then be matched to the measured peaks by creating a fragmentation tree, using an iterative, breadth-first algorithm. It has recently been updated to allow users to search a wider selection of databases to identify candidate molecules to generate tological fragments from. Users can also select filtering criteria by inclusion or exclusion of substructures and elements.
