## Description
Ratio analysis of mass spectrometry (RAMSY) aims to remove the effect of interfering peaks and simplify the spectra. It is based on RANSY (Ratio analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). It is calculated by calculating the ratios between a driving peak and all the other features in a spectra. It is available as a web app, matlab script and excel macro.
