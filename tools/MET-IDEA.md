## Description
Metabolomics Ion-based Data Extraction Algorithm (MET-IDEA) performs preprocessing and metabolite identification of GC-MS data. It can also be used for LC-MS, but it is not optimised for these. It is designed to take AMDIS output as input and can quantify the results. As input it takes a list of ions and their retention times. From these it generates mass spectral tags. A user inputed list containing a mass spectral library can be used for metabolite identification. Optionally mass and/or retention time values can be calibrated by user selected markers.
