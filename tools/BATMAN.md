## Description
Bayesian automated metabolite analyser for NMR spectra (BATMAN) provides a bayesian model for deconvolution of NMR spectra and an MCMC algorithm to automate metabolite quantification. It is also able to automatically identify metabolites based on user defined metabolite chemical shift lists. A two component model is used for peak deconvolution: for some peaks a metabolite identification can be explicitly defined using an online database (HMDB) and for others the unassigned spectrum is modelled semiparametrically, using wavelets. As well as the R package, there is also the tool splineFitBATMAN, which allows the user to sort the spectra and estimate chemical shifts for each resonance.
