## Description
SpinAssign is a statistical index designed for the simultaneous annotation of many metabolites. It is a web-based application. Queried peaks are matched against a database of 1H and 13C chemical shifts and the p-values are calculated, where 1 is a 100% match. The database contains more than 1700 13C HSQC peaks, corresponding to 270 metabolites. The uniqueness (the extent to which a peak overlaps the reference chemical peak) is calculated. The annotation results are linked to KEGG.
