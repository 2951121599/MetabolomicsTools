## Description
Complex mixture analysis by NMR (COLMAR) is designed for the analysis of covariance-NMR (2D) data of complex mixtures. There are three web-servers: one to calculate the NMR covariance spectrum from the raw input, one to decompose 2D covariance TOCSY spectrum into a reduced set of non-redundant 1D cross sections and one to screen the traces against a spectral database for metabolite identification via the BMRB and HMDB. Prior to processing there is the option to remove the water line.
