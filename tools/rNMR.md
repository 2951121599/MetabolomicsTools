## Description
Designed for analysis 1D and 2D NMR spectra using a ROIs based approach (which contain all of the underlying NMR data), rather than the traditional peak lists. ROI can be visually inspected to help aid accurate quantification. It contains a convert function, which will convert raw NMR files into a format that rNMR can analyse. It contains 3 automatic peak picking buttons: Full, Region and ROI. The produced peak lists can then be directly exported to MMCD or uploaded to BMRB for identification.
