## Description
MetabolomeExpress is designed to perform three main functions: 1) Store GC-MS metabolomics data, allowing for analysis without the user having to download the data 2) provide a GC-MS analysis pipeline and 3) store metabolite response statistics. The PeakFinder algorithm, which uses a slope-based peak detection method is used for peak picking. Next the MRSI library matching algorithm takes EIC peak lists, a reference library and RI calibration file as input for metabolite identification. In this EIC peaks are grouped by their apex RIs into 'preliminary spectra', followed by a library search on each bin. Both internal and external RI calibration are supported. Users may supply their own libraries (including from AMDIS) or use a MetabolomeExpress supplied library. For statistical analysis: PCA, HCA, Welch's t-tests and heat maps are provided.
