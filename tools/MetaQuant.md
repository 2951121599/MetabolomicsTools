## Description
This is designed for the quantification of GC-MS data and also provides metabolite identification. A mixture of internal standards with known concentrations must first be run, allowing MetaQuant to solve the integrals of the peaks for calibration. The known concentrations are then used, along with peak areas as calibration points for regression analysis. There are a number of different regression methods available: linear, polynomial, power or exponential regression. For quantification, peaks of interest are first identified and then integrated and the appropriate regression function is used.
