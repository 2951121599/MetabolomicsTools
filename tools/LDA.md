## Description
Lipid Data Analyser (LDA) peak picks LC-MS lipidomics data by a novel algorithm designed for accurate quantification. Firstly a chromatograph is extracted and the time-point at peak summit is identified. Next a m/z range is extracted around this narrow time point. The peak summit is then redetermined and the border points of the profile peaks are detected and an ellipse fitted. It uses theoretical isotope distribution as an exclusion criteria. There is no deisotopic step. Three standardisation methods are available: based on a single standard, a median method and internally developed methodology (standardisation by most robust standards).
