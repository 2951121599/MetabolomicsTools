## Description
It provides deisotoping, annotation of fragments and adducts, metabolite identification with LipidMaps and HMDB and annotation confidence estimation. It is designed to receive a xcms peak table as input, which must contain a single polarity only. The confidence estimation of annotation can be performed using either bayesian inference (using network presence/ missing metabolites) or observed/theoretical isotope distribution pattern.
