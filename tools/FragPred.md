## Description
Multiple reaction modelling (MRM) is a QQQ mode. It has traditionally just been used for small data sets of authenticated standards. FragPred aims to extend MRM for all of the metabolites in the METLIN database. Logistic regression fitted with L1-regularized objective was used to model the likelihood of a molecule ionising and producing a structure in METLIN. This results in a list of predicted fragments.
