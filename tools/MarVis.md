## Description
Marker Visualization (MarVis) - Pathway is an addition to the MarVis Suite, which provides metabolic pathway visualisation and MSEA. Pathway databases are implemented from KEGG and BioCyc. Three forms of SEA are available: entry-based (hypergeometric distribution), marker/feature-based (static or iterative hypergeometric distribution) and sample based analysis (rank-sum or Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests). Custom databases can be imported in the .CSV format, as the KEGG/BioCyc pathways cannot be adjusted. Both transcriptomics and proteomics data can also be used in conjunction with the metabolomics data.
