## Description
This CRAN package performs both preprocessing and metabolite identification of GC-MS data. The intensity of each fragment is transformed into a relative percentage of the highest mass fragment per spectrum. Unsupervised clustering methods are then used to group fragments. There is optionally an algorithm to compute the best clustering method for the data. When the data is clustered, it can be identified if the user provides a list of commercial standards or manually assigned reference compounds. NIST can also be directly searched for metabolite identification.
