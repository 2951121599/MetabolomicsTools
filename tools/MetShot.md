## Description
MetShot provides nearline data-dependent acquisition (DDA) LC-MS/MS processing strategies. With its pipeline, it is designed for the optimum collection of LC-MS/MS data. Firstly LC-MS raw data must be gathered and analysed (preprocessing with XCMS and CAMERA) to identify features of interest. These features of interest can then be analysed with DDA LC-MS/MS. It generates target peak lists for MS/MS analysis from single LC-MS runs (for Bruker micrOTOF-Q, Agilent QTOF and Waters QTOF). Once LC-MS/MS data has been collected, peaks are identified using the centWave algorithm and grouped using CAMERA algorithms.
