## Description
This is designed for the detection of features in GC-MS data without the need to use a reference compound library. Every spectrum is compared to every other spectrum using the Gemoda algorithm, which finds pairwise similarity of clusters (cliques) using weighted dot product. The most representative spectra for each clique is chosen. This allows it to identify which features are preserved across samples. It can also find peaks which differentiate between conditions. It requires that the user provides sample replicates (technical, but it is also desirable to include biological).
