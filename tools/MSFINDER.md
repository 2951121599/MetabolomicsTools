## Description	
This RIKEN software is designed for the putative identification of unknown metabolites in LC-MS/MS data, using a three stage process. Firstly, MS1 and MS/MS molecular formulas are predicted using the seven golden rules and a neutral loss database. The chemistry development kit (CDK) is then used to fragment structural data from PubChem matching these molecular formula. Finally candidate compounds are ranked using a likelihood score. Candidates are filtered by whether or not they are present in an existing metabolite database.
