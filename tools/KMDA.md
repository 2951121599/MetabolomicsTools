## Description
Kernel-Based Metabolite Differential Analysis (KMDA) is a CRAN package, which provides a kernel-based score test to cluster metabolites between treatment groups, in order to handle missing values. There are two kernels: one distance-based and the other stratified, in order to capture both the discrete and continuous nature of metabolomics data.
