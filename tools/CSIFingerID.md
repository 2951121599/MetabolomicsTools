## Description	
Compound Structure Identification:FingerID (CSI:FingerID) provides structure identification of MS/MS data. For compound prediction machine learning is used to first compute a fragmentation tree and from this predict a molecular fingerprint. The predicted fingerprint is then compared to molecular structures in a database, such as PubChem. CSI:FingerID was trained on GNPS 1.2.8 and Massbank Orbitrap and Q-TOF spectra. Currently there is no option to perform batch searches. In CASMI 2016, CSI:FingerID came second in the "Best Automatic Structural Identification - In Silico Fragmentation Only" category.
