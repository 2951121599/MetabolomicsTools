## Description
This is designed for between and within-batch correction of LC-MS data. There are functions for batch alignment, drift correction and batch normalisation. For batch alignment feature missingness is aggregated on a batch level, features with missingness that are sufficiently similar m/z and retention time and ensuring orthogonal batch presence among feature alignment candidates. Drift correction is performed using clustering (mclust) on features in observation space. It provides a trade-off between the power per drift pattern and the multiple drift patterns within the dataset. For batch normalisation either QC/Reference or population (median) normalisation can be used. A quality heuristic is used to determine whether the QC/Reference is suitable for normalisation; if it is not, median normalisation is used instead.
