## Description
Visualisation Identification and Alignment (VIA) provides simultaneous manual inspection and correction of identifications and alignments. It is based on Maui, an existing GC-MS processing software. It is designed to enable simultaneously process and correct assignments and alignments of GC-MS by providing a visualisation engine. Data should have been already peak picked and baseline corrected prior to import into Maui-VIA. Retention indices are calculated using linear interpolation. A user-imported metabolomics library in the .msp format can be supplied for feature annotation using a reverse search.
