## Description
Metabolomics Pathway Analysis (MetPA) offers both overrepresentation analysis and GSEA-based approaches, with algorithms offered including: Fishers' eaxct test, hypergeometric test, global test and GlobalAncova. Relative betweeness centrality and out degree centrality measures are used to assign compound importance. Pathway impact is calculated by the sum of the importance measures of the matched metabolites normalised by the sum of the importance measures of all the metabolites in the pathway. Univariate analysis (one-way ANOVA, t-test and linear regression) can then be used to statistically analyse the importance of individual metabolites in phenotypes. Pathways are from KEGG. As of 2011 MetPA is part of MetaboAnalyst.
