## Description
MetSizeR is a CRAN package that provides a GUI for estimating the sample size required for targeted and NMR metabolomics experiments, even when pilot studies are not available. When a pilot study is not available, pseudo-metabolomic data is simulated with a statistical model. The statistical model used depends on which of probabilistic principal components analysis (PPCA), probabilistic principal components and covariates analysis (PPCCA) or dynamic probabilistic principal components analysis (DPPCA) the user intends to use for analysis of the studies data. The user must specify the desired FDR and the optimal sample size is the one with this FDR. When there is a pilot study available the Test Statistic is estimated using a permutation technique, maintaining between subject variability and noise level.
