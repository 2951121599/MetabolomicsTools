## Description
This is designed for the analysis of TOF-SIMS (time of flight - secondary ion mass spectrometry). It provides preprocessing functions. A template based alignment algorithm is used: first peaks are ordered by their intensity (descending), then a template including nonredundant peaks is generated. The peaks are then aligned to the reference peaks and similarity measures are generated.
