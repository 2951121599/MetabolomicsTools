## Description
This provides metabolite identification for preprocessed DIA LC-MS/MS lipidomics data, using rt-aligned monoisotopic masses of molecular (MS) and fragment (MS/MS) ions. It is a modular based software, consisting of 5 modules: building block, precursor candidates, fragment candidates, mass analyzer and lipid identification. Firstly monoisotopic masses are calculated from elemental composition of the lipid building blocks (heads and tails). Different heads and tails are combined in the precursor candidates modules and potential adducts are identified. The monoisotopic masses of the expected fragments are then calculated. Putative fragments and molecular ions are then matched to the inputted m/z values. Lipid candidates are then identified after time-alignment.
