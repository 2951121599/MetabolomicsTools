## Description
Cross-contribution robust multiple standard normalization (crmn) is a CRAN package which provides normalisation for metabolomics data. crmn is a normalisation technique which can be used to normalise metabolomics data which has been generated with internal standards. A number of other normalisation methods are also included: NOMIS, One (divide each analyte by a single user-defined IS), RI (divide each analyte by the abundance estimate of the IS, closest in terms of RI), totL2 (ensures the square sum of each sample is the same), median and average normalisation.
