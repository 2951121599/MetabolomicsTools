## Description
This bioconductor package provides tools for retention time alignment and intensity drift correction of spectra that are measured over time. It is an add on to the ALS package which implements alternating least squares (multivariate curve resolution) for analysis of chemical data, in particular hyphenated data where the first direction is a retention time axis, and the second a spectral axis e.g. HPLC-DAD (high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection). It also provides filtering of peaks below an intensity threshold.
