## Description
Competitive Fragment Modeling for Metabolite Identification (CFM-ID) is a web server designed for ESI-MS/MS data analysis. It uses single energy - competitive fragmentation modeling (SE-CFM) to predict MS/MS spectra, for MS/MS peak annotation and for putative metabolite annotation. There are two SE-CFM which were trained on the METLIN database, one for positive and one for negative modes. Spectra can be predicted for three collision energies: 10V, 20V and 40V, requiring an input of SMILES or InChI formats of chemicals of interest. Putative MS/MS peak annotation requires input of a peak table and a list of metabolites in SMILES or InChI format. Putative Metabolite Annotation can be performed using HMDB, KEGG or a user defined list of metabolites.
