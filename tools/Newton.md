## Description
This program can either be used locally or as a web-based application. It is specifically designed for the analysis of 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectra, but can also be applied to 1D 1H and 2D 1H-TOCSY spectra. The fast maximum likelihood reconstruction (FMLR) is used to perform spectral deconvolution iteratively. A data ensemble of three distinct spectra is constructed: a data spectrum acquired from conventional Fourier transformation  of the acquired FID, a model spectrum obtained from the sum of the cropped signals of a synthetic time domain along each dimension and a residual spectrum which is the difference between the data and model spectra. It allows input of data directly from NMRPipe.
