## Description
This CRAN package provides probabilistic PCA (PPCA), probabilistic principal components and covariates analysis (PPCCA) and mixtures of probabilistic principal component analysis (MPPCA) for modelling metabolomics data. PPCA is based on the Gaussian latent variable model. PPCCA incorporates covariates into the model, which is useful for analysing human data, where other phenotypic data (age, gender, BMI) are also gathered, as well as metabolomic data. In this model it is assumed that the latent variable distribution for observations follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution that is not centred at the origin, like PPCA. A collection of PPCA models can be combined for MPPCA for non-linear modelling purposes. MPCCA clusters observations into groups and reduces data dimensionality.
