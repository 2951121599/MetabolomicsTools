## Description
Analysis of Lipid Experiments (ALEX) is designed for metabolite identification of multiplexed FT MS data. Lipids are identified using the ALEX lipid database containing >20,000 lipid species. This can be searched as part of the GUI or on a web-based tool, which requires a m/z list as input. For calibration of FT MS data, the identity of a well characterised lock-mass ion must be known for the online tool. For the pipeline it can be calculated automatically, using lock mass adjustment. A three-point quadratic interpolation is used for estimating the centroid m/z values of lock mass ions. Lipids can also be quantified using the Orange software.
