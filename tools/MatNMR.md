## Description
This software has both a GUI and programmatic access, providing a MATLAB toolbox for NMR spectrum processing, analysis and visualisation. It contains a number of processing functions: data shifting, DC offset correction, solvent deconvolution, apodization, Fourier transformation, phase correction, baseline correction and shearling transformation. For analysis spectral deconvolution, relaxation and diffusion-curve fitting, CSA tensor fitting and quadrupolar tensor fitting functions are provided. This software is not designed specifically for metabolomics. There is not currently a paper available for this software.
