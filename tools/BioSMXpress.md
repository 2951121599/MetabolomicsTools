## Description
This is an add on to BioSM that is designed specifically to identify endogenous mammalian metabolites based on their molecular structure, as opposed to synthetic molecules. It aims to use the smallest number of structure comparisons possible for the identification of metabolites. 'Scaffolds' (1564 endogenous mammalian compounds identified from KEGG) are searched against for identification - if the smaller structure is an exact substructure of the larger this is considered a match. BioSMXpress only identifies metabolites as biological or non-biological. A list of SMILES is required as input into the software.
