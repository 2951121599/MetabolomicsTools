## Description
Isotope correction toolbox (ICT) can be used for isotope correction of MS/MS data. It can be applied to any labeling source and any element and isotope can be considered. When the input is read, the correction matrix is generated. First the ratio of isotopes in the precursor and product ions are calculated and then combined as ratios and the ratios of individual isotopes are combined. The probability of occurrence of each isotope ratio is calculated and these are used to create the correction matrix. Negative correction ratios can arise and these are set to zero.
