## Description
This is designed as a complete workflow for NMR analysis. It contains functions for preprocessing, pretreatment, modeling and validation. Preprocessing functions include: apodization, zero-filling, Fourier transformation, phase correction, ROI selection, peak picking, integration and referencing. Functions for data pretreatment include scaling, normalisation, alignment, binning and denoising. A number of statistical techniques are also provided: PCA, LDA, PLS and OPLS. Monte Carlo n-fold internal cross-validation is used and CV-ANOVA and response permutation significance testing can be used to validate supervised models. It also contains an implementation of the icoshift algorithm.
