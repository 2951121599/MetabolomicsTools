## Description
MetScape allows for the visualisation of metabolic networks in cytoscape, accepting lists of metabolites or genes as input. These can be visualised as: compound-reaction-enzyme-gene (CREG), compound-reaction (CR), compound-gene (CG) or compound (C) networks. The gene set enrichment tool LRpath can be used for metabolite or gene data enrichment. Metab2MeSH is used to annotate compounds with information from KEGG, PubChem and the literature. There is the option of creating subnetworks and expanding the currently displayed network.
