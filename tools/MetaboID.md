## Description
This program is designed to allow the comparison of the experimental spectra to those of authentic compound standards, with the aim of compound assignment. MetaboID is built upon a library of 360 unique small molecule spectra from BMRB and HMDB. It also allows input of a user-defined metabolite library. When a full-resolution spectrum is imported, it is normalised for intensity and the water and urea (4.5-6ppm) is set to 0 to eliminate the solvent signal.
