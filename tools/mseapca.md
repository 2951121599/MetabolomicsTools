## Description
Metabolite set enrichment analysis for factor loading in principal component analysis (mseapca), is a CRAN package that provides functions for MSEA and PCA. It is designed so that PCA is used to select metabolites for MSEA, where biological inferences can be made about them. There are three major features in this package. The first creates a list of metabolic pathways (either .csv or KEGG .tar.gz, depending on whether the list is user created or downloaded from KEGG). Secondly, PCA can be performed. This function includes automatic zero, mean and unit variance scaling. Finally MSEA can be performed with overrepresentation analysis (ORA) or using Subramanian et al's method.
