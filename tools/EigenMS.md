## Description
EigenMS provides normalisation of LC-MS metabolomics data using a singular value decomposition-based method. Firstly variation due to differences between experimental conditions is captured using ANOVA. Trends caused by bias are found by applying singular value decomposition to a matrix of residuals. These bias trends are then removed from the dataset.
