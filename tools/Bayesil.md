## Description
The web system, Bayesil is designed to supply automatic spectral processing and identification of serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 1D 1H NMR spectra. Automated zero-filling, Fourier and Hilbert transformation, phasing, baseline correction and solvent filtering, smoothing, chemical shift referencing and reference deconvolution. A reference compound with known concentration, is then used for quantification. The spectral library provided for metabolite identification contains 50 metabolites detected in human serum and 48 detected in CSF.
