## Description
Metabolite Biological Role (MBRole) is a web based tool for metabolite set enrichment analysis, providing categorical annotations of overrepresented metabolite groups. Pathways are taken from KEGG and SMPDB, enzyme interactions for KEGG and Biological role, chemical role and application from KEGG and ChEBI. Disease, chemical taxonomy, tissue, biofluid and cellular location are taken from HMDB, pharmacological action from PubChem and chemical groups from Checkmol. A list of compound IDs of compounds of interested (those which are differentially expressed) must be provided (KEGG/HMDB/PubChem/ChEBI/SMILES). Annotations for the input set are then statistically assessed against the background set (either organism specific/across the whole database/user-provided). Overrepresentation analysis is then performed with FDR being used; a list of input values which are overrepresented in the set is then returned, with associated p-values.
