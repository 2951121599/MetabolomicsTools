## Description
This bioconductor package is designed to determine the sum formula of metabolites based on their exact mass and isotopic pattern from high resolution MS. It integrates with XCMS, MassSpecWavelet and rpubchem. Input is a list of masses with normalised abundances that correspond to the isotope pattern of the same molecule. Firstly all elemental compositions that share a property of the target m/z are calculated, then compositions which do not exist in nature are removed and binding rules are applied. Unsaturated compositions are then removed. The theoretical isotope distribution pattern is then calculated and compared to the measured distribution pattern.
