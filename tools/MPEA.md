## Description
Metabolite Pathway Enrichment Analysis (MPEA) is designed for GC-MS metabolite enrichment analysis. It tests whether metabolites involved in a predefined pathway are at the top or bottom of a rank query compound list. As input either a pre-annotated list of compounds or GC-MS data with mass spectral tags (MSTs) must be used. MSTs are identified from the golm metabolome database. There are two modes of enrichment analysis: single set and iterative, with single set being used for unranked lists and iterative used for lists ranked by e.g. t-tests. A entity relationship matrix is created to resolve the many-to-many relationships between the query compounds and those in the pathway. The statistical significance is tested using the hypergeometric distribution. KEGG and SMPDB are used to obtain the pathways.
