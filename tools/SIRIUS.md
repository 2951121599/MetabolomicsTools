## Description
Sum formula identification by ranking isotope patterns using mass spectrometry (SIRUS) resolves the sum formula of a compound from its fragmented features using PubChem. The sum formula is calculated using the input mass and the natural isotope distribution. It does not aim to identify the 2D structure of the compound - only the sum formula. As of version 3.2 SIRIUS now has CSI:FingerID integration.
