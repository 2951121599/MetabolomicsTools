## Description
This is a metabolomics add on to the CcpNmr software. It contains fulled assigned 1D and 2D spectra of 76 of metabolites (those that are most commonly found in biofluids). It also contains predicted 1H-1H TOCSY spectra, that are not available on public repositories. It allows for the creation of custom, user defined libraries of spectra.
