## Description
This Fiehn lab tool allows metabolite identification of LC-MS/MS spectra, by searching a database of substructures of MS/MS spectra. It is particularly useful for identifying novel compound species that are not yet in tandem spectral databases. The four types of mass spectral features which can be searched for are: precursor ions, product ions, neutral losses and m/z differences. When data is inputted into the software, first spectral simplification is performed, by removing all features below a user defined intensity threshold. As well as substructures automatically generated by MS2Analyzer, 147 neutral losses were manually curated from Google Scholar. Implemented as both a GUI and command line for both novice users and bioinformaticians.
