## Description
This CRAN package provides functions for the chemometric analysis of NMR, IR or Raman spectroscopy data. It includes functions for spectral visualisation, peak alignment, HCA, PCA and model-based clustering. It is specifically designed for the analysis of metabolomics data, with the experimental design of treatment and control groups. Data should be in the .csv format with frequency values in the first column and intensity in the second. A standard pipeline would include: spectral inspection, baseline correction, alignment, removal of noise-only frequencies, binning and normalisation.
